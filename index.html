    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Ashraf Mawejje Kasibante, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Glasgow with a passion for building clean, user-centered digital experiences. I’ve worked across the full stack from embedded systems to web apps bringing together solid programming fundamentals with real-world problem solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            My recent experience includes interning with Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland, where I led the redesign of internal tools and public-facing pages using WordPress, Figma, and custom PHP integrations. I’ve also contributed to a CENSIS-backed IoT audio classification system, where I developed a real-time dashboard that visualized embedded sensor data using Python and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love building systems that solve real problems and scale well from reliable APIs to responsive user interfaces. Whether I’m working on a solo project or collaborating in an Agile team, I value clean code, clear communication, and continuous learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of tech, I enjoy gaming (especially FC 25 and WRC), exploring user experience design, and contributing to community-based tech initiatives.
